# Data-Engineering-Projects
Welcome to my Data Engineering repository where I explore various aspects of data processing, analysis, and modeling to extract meaningful insights. My projects range from cloud-based analytics to SQL data manipulations.

## Projects Overview

### FOMO (Function of Optimizing Missing Observations)
[Hyperlink Description](https://github.com/DigitalBiomarkerDiscoveryPipeline/FOMO)

I have been working with Duke Big Idea Lab to build a Python library to optimize missing observations in digital biomarkers. We aim to streamline this process for researchers to leverage their current data better.

### Cloud-Based Analytics
#### Formula 1 Analysis on Azure
I leverage Azure's powerful cloud-computing capabilities to dissect and analyze Formula 1 racing data. Dive into our findings and methodologies.
